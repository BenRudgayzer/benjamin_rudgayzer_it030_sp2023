  <h2>What Makes Me Unique?</h2> 
  <p> My current work experience as a Data Modeler employed at Agorai.ai, coupled with my other various work experiences/academic achievements, make me a very good fit for this role. I am hard-working and service-oriented, and I live for solving everyday problems with unique and practical solutions quickly and steadily. In this role, I have used my skills to automate specific processes and provide the company with a detailed financial forecast. My responsibilities also entail analyzing the data and using accounting principles and finance to portray a detailed financial analysis using Power Query and VBA. With my many experiences with on-campus involvement in the forms of various fraternities, clubs, and employment in which I hold leadership positions, I know that I have been taught the value of leadership and hard work. With these experiences, I can apply myself wherever I am needed.</p>

  <p> My academic experiences have served me well in developing my communication, motivation, and critical thinking skills. My education and prior work experience have given me a repetoir of many different programs that would be beneficial to the prosperity of analytics and data: such as Excel, problem-solving, SQL, R, Tableau, Java, Python, and many more. </p>
